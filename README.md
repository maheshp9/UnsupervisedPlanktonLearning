# Code for "Annotation-free learning of plankton for classification and anomaly detection"
Vito Paolo Pastore, Thomas Zimmerman, Sujoy K. Biswas and Simone Bianco. 

Plankton classifier.py contains the code to implement the Plankton Classifier pipeline.


The code is organized as a class (Plankton classifier). The main class allows to perform test and evaluate the results, as discussed in the paper,
for both the lensless microscope (or in general, video data) or the WHOI dataset (static data).

The data is accessible at:
https://ibm.box.com/v/PlanktonData

Data folder contains both the lensless and WHOI dataset. The datasets contain a 'TRAINING_IMAGE', 'BIN_TRAINING IMAGE' and a
'TRAINING_FEATURES' folders, same for test. Lensless dataset contain also the folder 'TRAINED DETECTORS' with the DEC-detectors models saved in format 'h5' together with the model of a trained neural network for classification (for testing as reported in the paper). 

For details about the total number of image per class and correspondent dataset, please refer to the paper. 
'BIN_TRAIN_IMAGE'
Segmentation resulting image
'TRAIN_FEATURES'
Features extracted. 

The initialization module to instantiate the class and performing the tests is:

  Test = PLANKTON_CLASSIFIER(address=address, image_segmentation_processing=0, feature_recomputing=0,
                           unsupervised_partitioning=1, classification=1, DEC_testing=1, oneclassSVM=1)
                          

Where address is the folder DATA downloaded from the provided links.

Image_segmentation_processing: if ==1 -> calls the image_processor module and performs image segmentation (creates folder 'BIN_TRAIN_IMAGE')

feature_recomputing: if == 1 -> calls the features extraction module and performs feature extraction (creates folder 'TRAIN_FEATURES')

Unsupervised_partitioning:  if == 1 -> calls the unsupervised partitioning module and performs the unsupervised partitioning based on Fuzzy K-means

Classification: if ==1 -> classification based on Neural network on test data, if ==2 ->  classification based on Random Forest on test data

DEC_testing: if ==1 -> DEC detectors test on single classes, and one-out test for detection of new species 

oneclassSVM: if ==1 -> One class SVM test for anomaly detection. 

In order to run the tests and replicate the results described in the manuscript, it is necessary to:
install python and the following set of packages:

Recommended requirements: python 3.6.0
Keras 2.2.4
Tensorflow-gpu 1.9.0
openCV 3.4.1 
scipy 1.1.0
sklearn 0.20.0
numpy 1.15.3
h5py 2.8.0

Substitute the address at line (1329) with the address of the downloaded dataset in your PC.
Choose and set the modules as explained before.
Run the module.
